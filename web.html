            <p class="fs">
                Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by
                challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. According to
                the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 44 children in the United States
                today,Globally, for every 100 children there is an autistic child .
<br>
                We know that there is not one autism but many subtypes, most influenced by a combination of genetic and
                environmental factors. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has a distinct set
                of strengths and challenges. The ways in which people with autism learn, think and problem-solve can
                range from highly skilled to severely challenged. Some people with ASD may require significant support
                in their daily lives, while others may need less support and, in some cases, live entirely
                independently.
<br>
                Several factors may influence the development of autism, and it is often accompanied by sensory
                sensitivities and medical issues such as gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, seizures or sleep disorders,
                as well as mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression and attention issues.
<br>

                Signs of autism usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays can appear even
                earlier, and often, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. Research shows that early intervention
                leads to positive outcomes later in life for people with autism.
